# OCOS-Chain Consensus Layer

**Hybrid | Quantum-Resistant | DAO-Driven | Auditable**

---

## Overview

The `/core/consensus` module is the heart of the OCOS-Chain protocol, responsible for secure block production, validation, and dynamic, on-chain governance. This layer integrates both **classical** and **post-quantum cryptography** for next-generation security and future-proof consensus. Designed for extensibility, auditability, and high performance in decentralized environments.

---

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Consensus Engine**  
  Supports Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Proof-of-Authority (PoA), and hybrid modes. Configurable by DAO governance.

- **Quantum-Resistant Signatures**  
  Native integration of post-quantum digital signatures (Dilithium, XMSS) alongside classic Ed25519, with modular upgradeability.

- **Validator Management**  
  Secure lifecycle management: staking, slashing, jail/unjail, retirement, metadata.

- **Block & Header Logic**  
  Canonical block structure with extensible metadata, deterministic hashing, state and transaction roots, and pluggable signature validation.

- **DAO On-Chain Governance**  
  Proposal and voting system for dynamic consensus/configuration changes. Full audit trail for protocol upgrades and parameter tuning.

- **Full Test Coverage**  
  Automated tests for validator lifecycle, block signatures (quantum/classic), governance, edge cases, and core consensus operations.

## Security & Best Practices

- **Quantum-safe by design** – Supports Dilithium, XMSS, and modular cryptography upgrades.
- **Governance-driven** – Consensus parameters can be updated on-chain via proposals and voting.
- **Audit-ready** – Every consensus action/event is loggable, traceable, and can be externally verified.
- **Modular** – Easy to extend for new cryptography, validator selection, governance rules.

---

## Extensibility

- Add new consensus modes (DPoS, BFT, etc.)
- Integrate advanced cryptographic primitives via `quantum_sig.rs`
- Connect on-chain and off-chain governance for complex DAO workflows
- Enhance audit logging and event tracing for regulatory compliance
