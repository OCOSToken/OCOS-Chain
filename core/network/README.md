# OCOS-Chain: Network Subsystem (`/network`)

**P2P | Modular | Auditable | Scalable | Blockchain-Ready**

---

## Overview

The `/network` directory forms the foundation of all networking functionality in the OCOS-Chain protocol. It includes modules for **peer-to-peer (P2P) communication**, **peer identification**, **message handling**, **synchronization**, **node status tracking**, **data transmission**, and **auditability**.  
This module is designed to be **modular**, **future-proof**, and **secure**.

## Core Submodules and Files

| File/Folder       | Purpose and Function                                                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mod.rs`          | Main entry point of the networking module; links all submodules               |
| `p2p.rs`          | Peer-to-peer communication, discovery, banning, status and connection control |
| `transport.rs`    | Unified transport layer for TCP/UDP/WebSocket, TLS, QUIC, etc.                |
| `message.rs`      | Standard structure for block, tx, ping, gossip and other network messages      |
| `codec.rs`        | Message serialization/deserialization (bincode, JSON, protobuf, etc.)          |
| `node.rs`         | Node identity, status monitoring, agent info, and trust score management       |
| `sync.rs`         | Block and tx synchronization, snapshot and state diff exchange                |
| `tests.rs`        | Unit and integration tests for all networking components                      |

## Key Features

- **Full P2P network** – Peer discovery, banning/whitelisting, handshake and efficient connection control.
- **Multi-protocol transport** – Unified interfaces for TCP, WebSocket, TLS, and more.
- **Auditable messaging** – All messages are standardized for serialization and traceability.
- **Synchronization and state exchange** – Efficient fork resolution, snapshot/state diff synchronization.
- **Node identity and trust scoring** – Reputation tracking and monitoring for governance and secure networks.

## Security and Best Practices

- **DoS and Sybil protection**: Ban list, heartbeat tracking, rate limiting, and reputation scoring.
- **Message-level auditability**: UUID, timestamps, and logging structure included.
- **Layer-agnostic design**: Easy to extend or replace underlying transport protocols.

## Use Cases

- Node joining and network sync
- Block and transaction propagation
- DAO snapshot and governance state sharing
- Real-time ping/pong, node health and telemetry
- Multi-protocol data transfer and network test coverage
