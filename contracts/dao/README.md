# OCOS-Chain: DAO Smart Contract Module

**Decentralized | Modular | Governance-Driven | Auditable**

---

## Overview

The `contracts/dao` module implements a complete on-chain DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) governance system for OCOS-Chain. It provides proposal management, weighted voting, membership logic, treasury controls, and secure execution of community-driven decisions—all at the smart contract layer.

---

## Features

- **Proposal lifecycle:** Create, review, approve, queue, execute, and reject on-chain proposals
- **Weighted voting:** Stake, reputation, or address-based voting power with quorum rules
- **Membership management:** Roles, tiers, join/exit logic, and dynamic permissioning
- **Treasury module:** DAO fund management, grant allocation, on-chain disbursement controls
- **Configurable governance:** Adjustable quorum, voting periods, thresholds, execution delays
- **Auditable storage:** Fully transparent proposal/vote ledger and event logs
- **On-chain upgradeability:** Self-governed parameter and code path updates

## Security & Audit

- **On-chain permission checks:** All state-changing actions validated against roles and thresholds
- **Reentrancy and replay protection:** Atomic proposal execution, idempotent voting logic
- **Full traceability:** Proposal, vote, and execution events are emitted for each state change
- **Upgradeable pathways:** DAO can propose and vote to update its own logic and config

---

## Use Cases

- DAO-based treasury and grant management
- Protocol upgrades and on-chain parameter changes
- Community voting for council, funding, or policy changes
- NFT project DAOs, pooled asset governance, investment syndicates

---

## Integration

- Interacts with `/core/consensus` for DAO hooks in block validation
- Leverages `/crypto` for voter signature and stake verification
- Integrates with `/ledger` for state and proposal tracking
