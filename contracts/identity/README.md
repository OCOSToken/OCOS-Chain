# OCOS-Chain: On-Chain Identity & Reputation Module

**DID | Profile | Soulbound | KYC/KYB | Reputation | Recovery | Group | Attestation | Governance**

---

## Overview

The `/identity` module delivers a fully modular, audit-ready, and extensible identity layer for OCOS-Chain.  
It supports decentralized identifiers (DID), user profiles, soulbound tokens (SBTs), on-chain KYC/KYB, reputation scores, social and guardian-based recovery, attestations, group/role membership, and governance for user, DAO, and enterprise identity needs.

## Features

- **Decentralized Identifiers (DID):** W3C-compatible on-chain DIDs with key management and endpoints  
- **Profile management:** On-chain profile, nickname, avatar, email, and custom fields  
- **Soulbound tokens (SBT):** Non-transferable credentials for KYC, DAO membership, and more  
- **On-chain KYC/KYB:** User and entity verification, compliance and ZK-privacy integration  
- **Reputation system:** Trust scores, DAO voting, peer review, and social proof mechanisms  
- **Guardian/social recovery:** Seed, multi-sig, social, and DAO-based recovery flows  
- **Group membership:** DAO, whitelist, role, community, and airdrop-based group management  
- **Attestation registry:** DAO or provider-issued verifiable attestations  
- **Governance:** Parameter/protocol upgrades, social recovery approval, config changes, and audit  
- **Event-driven architecture:** All changes and key actions emit chain events for monitoring and analytics

## Security & Audit

- **DAO and on-chain governance for every update and critical change**  
- **Multi-sig and social/guardian recovery**  
- **Event-driven full audit trail for identity, KYC, SBT, and governance operations**  
- **Zero-knowledge and hash-based privacy support**  

---

## Integration

- Works with `/core/consensus` for validator, staking, or membership authentication  
- Used by `/nft`, `/liquidity`, `/governance`, and `/dao` for permission and role enforcement  
- Provides secure, extensible on-chain identity for Web3 apps, DAOs, DeFi, and enterprises
