# OCOS-Chain: Audit, Compliance & Forensic Layer

**Trace | Log | Compliance | Event | Proof | Analytics | Forensics**

---

## Overview

The `/audit` module delivers a full, modular, and auditable infrastructure for OCOS-Chain.  
It supports tracing, structured logs, compliance, event normalization, commitment/proof generation, indexing, analytics, storage, and error handling—enabling both on-chain and off-chain audit and regulatory requirements.

---

## Features

- **Full trace and forensics:** Deep transaction, governance, VM, storage, and DAO-level action tracing
- **Structured logging:** Access, action, and compliance logs with actor, time, type, and result
- **Compliance checks:** KYC, DAO, treasury, voting power, and custom rules
- **Event normalization:** Decoding and unifying on-chain events from all contract standards
- **Merkle/commitment/zk-proof support:** Immutable proofs and zero-knowledge extensions for audit
- **Indexing and analytics:** High-speed search, monitoring, API/dashboard support for all audit data
- **Performance metrics:** Real-time, historical, and risk-based analytics for protocol and DAO
- **Universal storage:** Centralized and extensible audit storage for logs, proofs, events, compliance, etc.

## Security & Compliance

- **Immutable proofs:** All audit trails, logs, and events are hash/commitment secured
- **Full compliance checks:** KYC, DAO membership, and governance policies enforced on-chain
- **Audit forensics:** Complete trace and proof records for legal and regulator review
- **Integration with analytics:** Built for external API, dashboards, monitoring, and risk tools

---

## Integration

- Directly integrates with `/core/consensus`, `/governance`, `/identity`, `/liquidity`, and VM for full-protocol audit coverage
- Audit APIs are available for external audit, regulator, and risk management systems
